# Real-Time Public Health Watch for India

## Overview

This Streamlit application provides users with real-time (simulated using mock data) public health alerts for various regions in India. Leveraging the power of Groq's LLaMA 3 model, the app not only displays alerts but also offers simple explanations and tailored precautionary advice. This project aims to keep users informed about health risks and promote proactive health measures, particularly relevant in regions like Telangana.

## Key Features

- **Region-Specific Alerts:** Users can select a region in India (currently Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, and Karnataka are supported with mock data) to view relevant health alerts.
- **Intelligent Explanation:** For each alert, Groq's LLaMA 3 generates a user-friendly explanation of the health issue.
- **Tailored Advice:** The application provides specific and practical precautionary advice generated by LLaMA 3, relevant to the alert and the selected region.
- **Voice Output:** Integrated text-to-speech functionality (using `pyttsx3`) reads the alerts, explanations, and advice aloud for enhanced accessibility.
- **Severity Filter:** Users can filter alerts based on their severity level (Low, Medium, High) using a sidebar.
- **Date Filter:** Allows users to view alerts within a specific date range, also accessible via the sidebar.
- **Alert History:** A simple logging feature allows users to record the currently displayed alerts, with a history view available in the sidebar.
- **Engaging User Interface:** A clean and intuitive Streamlit UI with custom styling to enhance user experience.

## Tech Stack

- **Python:** The primary programming language.
- **Streamlit:** For building the interactive web user interface.
- **Groq API:** To access the LLaMA 3 model for generating explanations and advice.
- **`python-dotenv`:** To securely manage API keys and environment variables.
- **`pyttsx3`:** A text-to-speech library for voice output.
- **JSON:** Used for storing and managing mock health alert data.
- **Git:** For version control.
- **GitHub:** For repository hosting and collaboration.

## Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <https://github.com/Saikrishna-Janagama/realtime-health-alerts.git>
    cd realtime-health-alerts
   

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    It is highly recommended to create a virtual environment first:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
    venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```
    Then, install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    (Ensure you create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content if you haven't already:
    ```
    streamlit
    groq
    python-dotenv
    pyttsx3
    ```
    )

3.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add your Groq API key:
    ```
    GROQ_API_KEY=YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY
    ```
    Replace `YOUR_GROQ_API_KEY` with your actual Groq API key.

4.  **Mock Data:**
    Ensure you have the `health_alerts.json` file in the same directory as your `app.py` file. This file contains the sample health alert data.

## Running the Application

1.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
2.  Navigate to the project directory.
3.  If you created a virtual environment, make sure it is activated.
4.  Run the Streamlit application:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
    This command will open the application in your web browser.

## Usage

1.  Upon opening the application, you will see a title and a section to select your region.
2.  Use the dropdown menu to choose a region (e.g., Telangana).
3.  Click the "Get Latest Health Information" button.
4.  The app will display any current health alerts for the selected region, along with explanations and precautionary advice generated by Groq's LLaMA 3.
5.  You can use the sidebar to filter alerts by severity and date.
6.  The "Log Current Alerts" button in the sidebar allows you to record the displayed alerts in a simple session-based history, which can be viewed by checking the "Show Alert History" box.
7.  If text-to-speech is initialized successfully, the alerts, explanations, and advice will also be read aloud.

## Future Enhancements

- **Integration with Real-Time Health APIs:** Connect to official public health APIs (e.g., WHO, NCDC India) for truly real-time data.
- **More Granular Region Selection:** Allow users to select specific districts or cities.
- **User Authentication and Preferences:** Implement user accounts to save preferred regions and alert settings.
- **Push Notifications:** Explore the possibility of sending notifications to users when new alerts are issued for their selected regions.
- **Multilingual Support:** Allow the app to display information in different Indian languages.
- **Advanced Data Visualization:** Incorporate charts and graphs to show trends in health alerts.
- **Feedback Mechanism:** Allow users to provide feedback on the relevance and helpfulness of the generated explanations and advice.

## Note

This application currently uses mock data for demonstration purposes. For real-time and comprehensive health alerts, integration with official health APIs would be necessary.
